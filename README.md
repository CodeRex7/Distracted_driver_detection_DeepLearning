# Distracted-Driver-Detection-with-Deep-Learning
This project aims to detect the dangerous status of driving based on the images captured by the dashboard camera using deep learning and triggers an alarm so that it helps in reducing accidents and forms a first step towards increassing the accuracy for step driving car project by me in near future.

# Dataset

The dataset is obtained from 

https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data

The dataset contains 22,424 images which belongs to one of the 10 classes given below:

    c0: safe driving
    
    c1: texting - right
    
    c2: talking on the phone - right

    c7: reaching behind
    
    c8: hair and makeup
    
    c9: talking to passenger
    
We split the data into two sets: training set containing 20,924 images, and validation set containing 1500 images (e.g., 150 images for each class).
